Reliability is the measure of your systems ability to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when itâ€™s expected to. This means the system is available for use and able to operate the workload through its total lifecycle. 
Availability = "Available for Use Time" / "Total Time"
High availability (HA) is a quality of a system or component that assures a high level of operational performance for a given period of time. 
High availability functions as a failure response mechanism for infrastructure. The way that it works is quite simple conceptually but typically requires some specialized software and configuration.
Implementing high availability for your infrastructure is a useful strategy to reduce the impact of these types of events. Highly available systems can recover from server or component failure automatically.
